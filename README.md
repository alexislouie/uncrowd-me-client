Uncrowd Me
=================
Uncrowd Me shows users the least crowded places near by so they can avoid crowds and long lines.

Background
----------
We've all experienced it. The elbow-to-elbow crowds at your favorite grocery store. Long lines wrapping around the block at that restaraunt you're meeting your friends at. The lack of seating at your local cafe when you just need to get some work done. 

Uncrowd Me allows users to search places ahead of time so they never have to wait in line again.
